## Introduction
Heart disease prediction is a critical task for the healthcare industry. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the presence or absence of heart disease based on various medical attributes.

## Project Overview
This project can be divided into several key steps:

- **Data Loading:** The project begins by loading a heart disease dataset (provided in dataset.csv) using pandas.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Missing values in the dataset are removed to ensure data quality.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Basic data analysis and visualizations are conducted to understand the dataset.

- **Model Building and Prediction:** A logistic regression model is trained on the dataset for heart disease prediction.

- **Model Evaluation:** The model's accuracy is evaluated to assess its performance.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you need to follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/assiltarhouni/heart-disease-predictive-model.git`

2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook heart_disease_prediction.ipynb`

## Data Preprocessing
Missing values are handled by removing rows with missing data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Basic data analysis includes summary statistics and data visualizations to understand the dataset's characteristics.

## Model Building and Prediction
A logistic regression model is trained for heart disease prediction. The model is used to make predictions.

## Model Evaluation
Model accuracy is calculated using the test set, providing an assessment of the model's performance.
